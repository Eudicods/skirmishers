\emph{Skirmishers} is an "I go, you go" (IGOUGO) system, with each side activating all of their units on their turn.
Each turn represents approximately 5 seconds of combat action.
One side randomly is chosen to start and then the two sides alternate until the game is complete.
The basic flow of the game is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Side 1 Activates

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Remove all firing arc tokens for Side 1.

    \item Move units one at a time.
       If a unit activates in or moves into an enemy's firing arc, resolve the attack immediately if the enemy unit chooses to fire.

    \item At the end of each unit's movement, that unit may take a combat action.

    \item After all units have moved, resolve any explosives.

  \end{enumerate}

  \item Side 2 Activates

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Remove all firing arc tokens for Side 2.

    \item Move units one at a time.
       If a unit activates in or moves into an enemy's firing arc, resolve the attack immediately if the enemy unit chooses to fire.

    \item At the end of each unit's movement, that unit may take a combat action.

    \item After all units have moved, resolve any explosives.

  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
