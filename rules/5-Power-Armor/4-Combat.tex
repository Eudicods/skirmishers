Power armor troopers largely use the same rules as standard troopers.

\paragraph*{Firing Arcs}

Power armor troopers may place firing arcs for all of their weapons.
If a weapon does not have a firing arc, then that weapon cannot fire.
If one of a power armor trooper's weapons is an explosive, this trooper may use the explosive and establish firing arcs with their other weapons.

\paragraph*{Hand to Hand Combat}

It costs 5 AP to make a hand to hand attack.
Power armor troopers may expend additional AP to increase the bludgeoning damage of their attacks.
The amount of bludgeoning damage is given by half the AP used to make the attack, rounded down.
