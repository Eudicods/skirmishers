The unit card shows the current capabilities of a trooper and tracks damage.
A unit card can be formatted in any way so long as it contains all the essential information.
Below is a sample unit card for a basic infantry trooper.

Basic information about the trooper, such as their name, rank, squad position number, and skill level are tracked at the top of the unit card.
This section also tracks the squad leader and their leadership skill.

Damage to the trooper is tracked in the HP section.
HP cells are labeled by their HP value, from highest to lowest, 10 to 1, from left to right.
HP cells are fully crossed out when the trooper takes lethal damage (X) and partially crossed out when the trooper takes bludgeoning damage (\textbackslash).
The current HP of the trooper is given by the first cell to the right of the lowest fully crossed out HP cell.
For example, if the trooper has HP 9, 7, and 6 fully crossed out and HP 5 partially crossed out, then their current HP is 5.

Total action points (AP) for the trooper are given in the AP section.
A regular trooper has 8 AP at 10 HP.
Use the AP value in the column corresponding to the trooper's current HP.
For example, if a regular trooper has 5 HP, then they have 7 AP.

Similarly, the modifier section tracks the current modifier for the trooper's target numbers from damage.
For example, if the trooper has 5 HP, then add +2 to all target numbers.

The trooper can wear body armor.
A trooper ignores bludgeoning damage while wearing armor and any cells of armor are destroyed before applying lethal damage to the trooper.
Mark off any unused cells of armor before the game.

The weapons section lists the primary and secondary weapons the trooper is carrying, along with their damage values and range brackets.
Basic troopers also carry 4 hand grenades and may carry additional equipment.
Any rifle or SMG automatically comes with a bayonet attached.
