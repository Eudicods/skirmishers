Under the standard rules, a trooper ignores bludgeoning damage while wearing armor and any cells of armor are destroyed before applying lethal damage to the trooper.
With the advanced body armor rules, the body armor protects a number of contiguous cells in the armor section of the unit card.
Only HP cells protected by body armor ignore bludgeoning damage.
Lethal damage is marked on the unit card like bludgeoning damage on the cell of body armor.
The first hit with lethal damage partially crosses out the armor cell (\textbackslash) and the second hit fully crosses out the armor cell (X).

To equip body armor on a trooper, mark the cells covered by body armor on the unit card.
Then, reduce the trooper's AP to account for the body armor.
For example, with standard body armor, mark 4 contiguous cells as protected by armor and reduce all values in the AP row by 2.
