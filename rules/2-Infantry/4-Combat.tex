After moving, troopers may use any remaining AP for combat actions, such as establishing a firing arc, engaging in hand to hand combat, or using explosives.

\paragraph*{Firing Arcs}

A trooper may establish a 30 degree, 60 degree, or 150 degree firing arc by paying the corresponding AP.
When establishing a firing arc, the vertex of the arc is the dot the trooper is standing on and can be oriented in any direction.
When an enemy trooper activates in or moves into the firing arc, the firing trooper may fire upon the targeted trooper.
This attack is resolved before the targeted trooper continues their movement.

\paragraph*{Resolving Fire}

Note: Players resolve fire during the enemy movement, which occurs during your opponent's turn.

If an enemy trooper activates in or moves into a firing arc, the firing trooper may choose to fire as long as the firing trooper has line of sight.
A trooper may decide not to fire if they wish to preserve the firing arc for a future target.

Draw a straight line between the firing trooper and the targeted trooper.
Obstructions, such as furniture, light vegetation, and low walls, provide cover but do not block line of sight.
Impassible obstacles, such as a solid high wall, the truck of a tree, or a trooper, block line of sight.

Resolving fire is a 2D6 check with the firing trooper's current active weapon.
If the roll meets or exceeds the target number, the attack succeeds.

The base target number for ranged attacks is 6.
Count the number of dots in the shortest path between the firing trooper and target trooper to determine the range.
There is no modifier to the target number if the weapon is in short range.
If the weapon is in long range add a +2 modifier to the target number.

Add any modifiers based upon the firing trooper's current HP.
Add a +1 modifier for each obstruction in the path of fire between the firing trooper and the target trooper, except for any obstruction between the firing trooper and any adjacent dots.
Use a -1 modifier if the firing trooper is prone.
Add a +1 modifier if the targeted trooper is prone and greater than 1 dot away.
Use a -1 modifier if the targeted trooper is prone and 1 dot away.

\end{table}

If the attack succeeds, roll an additional 2D6.
This is the initial cell to apply damage in.

Each weapon has a lethal damage value (X) and a bludgeoning damage value (\textbackslash).
Lethal damage is applied first.
Starting with the initial cell, fully cross out the number of HP cells given by the lethal damage value (X) of the weapon, skipping any previously fully crossed out cells.
If a cell is protected by body armor, partially cross out the body armor cell instead of marking the HP cell.
If a body armor cell is partially crossed out, then fully cross out the body armor cell.

Then apply any bludgeoning damage (\textbackslash).
Starting with the first cell after the last cell affected by the lethal damage, or the intial cell if the weapon does not have a lethal damage value (X).
Partially cross out the number of HP cells given by the bludgeoning damage value (\textbackslash) of the weapon.
If an HP cell is partially crossed out, then fully cross out the cell.
If a cell is protected by body armor, then bludgeoning damage has no effect for this cell.

The targeted trooper's new HP is given by the first cell to the right of the lowest fully crossed out HP cell.
The corresponding maximum AP is given by this column on the unit card.
The new maximum AP immediately applies to the targeted trooper.
If this new AP value meets or exceeds the AP the targeted trooper has spent this turn, the targeted trooper immediately falls prone and can take no further actions.

If the weapon is not a burst fire weapon (auto pistol, SMG, or laser SMG), then remove the firing arc once the firing is resolved.
A trooper may decide not to fire if they wish to preserve the firing arc for a future target.

\paragraph*{Hand to Hand Combat}

It costs 5 AP to make a hand to hand attack.
Hand to hand combat is resolved in the same way as ranged combat, and the attack is resolved during the targeted trooper's turn when they activate.

The attacking trooper must have a hand to hand weapon active.
The attacking trooper may use an affixed bayonet or use their active weapon as a club.

Resolving hand to hand combat is a 2D6 check with the attacking trooper's current active weapon.
If the roll meets or exceeds the target number, the attack succeeds.

The base target number for melee attacks is 4.
Apply all appropriate modifiers given above, except any modifiers for cover.
Damage is applied as above.

\paragraph*{Explosives}

AP cost for attacks with explosives are determined by the weapon.
A thrown grenade costs 1 AP for each dot its thrown, and a thrown satchel charge costs 2 AP for each dot its thrown.
Double these AP costs if the attacking trooper is prone.
A trooper cannot set up a firing arc after using an explosive.
The explosive must be the trooper's current active weapon in order to make an attack with an explosive.
A trooper automatically switches back to their primary or secondary weapon after using a grenade or satchel charge, for 0 AP.

A trooper can throw a hand grenade or satchel charge down a ladder or stairs any number of levels or up one level, at a cost of 3 AP.
The trooper must be standing on the stairwell or ladder to throw the explosive up a level and may be on or adjacent to the stairwell or ladder to throw the explosive down any number of levels.

Explosives are resolved similarly to ranged combat, but the attack is resolved at the end of the attacking side's turn.
Place a token at the targeted dot for the explosives during the trooper's turn and resolve the explosive after all troopers on your side have activated.

Resolving explosives is a 2D6 check with the firing trooper's current active explosive.
If the roll meets or exceeds the target number, the attack succeeds.

The base target number is the number of AP used to throw the hand grenade or satchel charge.
Apply all appropriate modifiers given above.
Since explosives target a dot and not a trooper, do not apply any modifiers for a prone target.

If the target number is met, apply damage starting at the targeted dot and moving outwards.
Damage is applied as above.
Impassible obstacles between the center of the explosion and the affected trooper, such as a solid high wall or the truck of a tree, block explosive damage.
Low solid obstructions such as furniture and windows also block explosive damage if the affected trooper is prone.

If the target number is not met, the explosive scatters.
The explosive scatters from the targeted dot.
Roll 1D6 to determine the scatter direction, identifying one direction to correspond to a result of 1 and proceeding clockwise with the other values.
If the path of scatter intersects an impassible obstacle, such as a solid high wall, then the explosive does not scatter and the center of the explosion stays on the targeted dot.
Move the center of the explosion to the new dot and apply damage as above.
