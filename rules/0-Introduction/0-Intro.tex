\emph{Skirmishers} is a 25mm scale infantry combat game.
Any models near this scale may be used; however, it is recommended to use models with a base size of 20mm or smaller, which is approximately the size of a standard US penny.
Players control a squad of infantry navigating a ground combat environment.
This system is setting agnostic and can be used with any miniatures and maps of the appropriate scale.
