Troopers equipped with jet packs may move further than standard troopers.
Jet packs are heavy, and troopers wearing jet packs receive a -2 AP penalty.

It costs 3 AP to activate a jet pack.
When activating a jet pack, a trooper must move 6 to 16 dots.
A jet pack cannot be used to move fewer than 6 dots, and a jet pack can only be used once in a turn.
A jet pack can only be used outdoors or next to a window or door if the trooper immediately goes outside during the flight.

A trooper can go up or down in elevation 1 level for every 3 dots they travel.
For example, if a trooper activated a jet pack to move 10 dots, then they can go up or down in elevation by up to 3 levels.
A trooper on the ground could land on the roof of a two story building by moving at least 6 dots when activating their jet pack.

If a trooper flies through an enemy firing arc, the trooper may be fired upon.
Apply a +2 modifier when targeting a flying trooper.
If the trooper receives damage that reduces their AP, they immediately fall prone on the ground.

A flying trooper may drop a hand grenade, if they have one ready.
The hand grenade may be dropped on any dot the trooper flies over.
Use 8 as the base target number and resolve the attack as usual.

A trooper may remove or equip a jet pack for 5 AP, and a jet pack may be exchanged between troopers for 6 AP, like with weapons or ammunition.
